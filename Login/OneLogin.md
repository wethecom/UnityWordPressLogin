To prevent a user from logging into your game from multiple computers simultaneously using the same credentials, you'll need to implement a mechanism to track active sessions in your system. This can be done by adding session management on your server-side, typically handled through your PHP backend and MySQL database. Here’s a basic approach to handle this:
 
### Step 1: Add a Session Tracking Table
You can create a new table in your MySQL database to track active sessions. This table should record the user's ID, a session token, and potentially the IP address or other relevant details that help identify the session uniquely.
 
```sql
CREATE TABLE active_sessions (
    session_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    session_token VARCHAR(255),
    login_timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_active_timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);
```
 
### Step 2: Generate Session Token
When a user logs in successfully, generate a unique session token. This can be done using a variety of methods in PHP, such as using `bin2hex(random_bytes(16))` for a random string.
 
### Step 3: Check for Existing Sessions
Before allowing a login to complete, check if there are any active sessions for this user. You can decide whether to allow multiple sessions or restrict to a single session based on your game’s requirements.
 
```php
// Assuming $userId is the user's ID
$query = "SELECT * FROM active_sessions WHERE user_id = ?";
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare($query);
$stmt->bind_param("i", $userId);
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();
 
if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
    // User already logged in
    echo "You are already logged in elsewhere.";
    exit;
} else {
    // No active sessions, proceed with login
}
```
 
### Step 4: Store New Session
If no active session exists or if you allow multiple sessions but want to track them, insert a new session record in the `active_sessions` table when a user logs in.
 
```php
$sessionToken = bin2hex(random_bytes(16));
$insertQuery = "INSERT INTO active_sessions (user_id, session_token) VALUES (?, ?)";
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare($insertQuery);
$stmt->bind_param("is", $userId, $sessionToken);
$stmt->execute();
```
 
### Step 5: Handle Logout
Ensure you handle the logout process by removing the session from the `active_sessions` table. Also, consider how you'll handle sessions that should expire due to inactivity.
 
```php
// When user logs out
$deleteQuery = "DELETE FROM active_sessions WHERE session_token = ?";
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare($deleteQuery);
$stmt->bind_param("s", $sessionToken);
$stmt->execute();
```
 
### Step 6: Session Expiry
Implement a mechanism to clear old sessions, such as a scheduled script that removes sessions that have not been active for a certain period, to prevent the table from growing indefinitely.
 
```php
// Scheduled script to run at regular intervals
$expiryQuery = "DELETE FROM active_sessions WHERE last_active_timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR";
$mysqli->query($expiryQuery);
```
 
Implementing this session management approach helps ensure that each login is unique per device or session as required, enhancing the security and integrity of user access to your game.
